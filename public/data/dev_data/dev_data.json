    "title": "Two migrants dead, 30 missing after shipwrecks off Italian coast",
    "text": "At least two people have died and more than 30 are missing after two ships carrying migrants sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa, the UN's migration agency said on Sunday.The two boats had set off from the port of Sfax in Tunisia carrying 48 and 42 people respectively.Police chief Emanuele Ricifari, who is in charge of the investigation, told local media the traffickers would have known that rough seas were forecast.\"Whoever allowed them, or forced them, to leave with this sea is an unscrupulous criminal lunatic,\" Mr Ricifari said.But they have said stormy weather and poor quality of the boats continue to complicate the situation.Mr Ricifari, urging the traffickers to stop, said: \"Rough seas are forecast for the next few days. Let's hope they stop. It's sending them to slaughter with this sea.\"NGOs say Italy's far-right government has made their task more difficult by passing laws that have the effect of forcing rescue ships to use faraway ports.Charities have warned that this increases their navigation costs and reduces the amount of time ships can patrol the areas of the Mediterranean where such disasters are common.The Italian Interior ministry said migration figures by sea had doubled this year to 92,000, compared with 42,600 recorded in the same period in 2022.",

    "title": "Philippines accuses China of firing water cannon at boats in South China Sea",
    "text": "There have recently been a number of similar naval stand-offs - like this one in June - between the Philippines and ChinaThe Philippine Coast Guard has accused its Chinese counterpart of firing water cannon at its vessels and blocking them in the disputed South China Sea.It said this happened when its ship was escorting boats carrying supplies for Filipino soldiers stationed on one of the contested Spratly Islands.Beijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the Spratlys, which is also claimed in part by the Philippines.In a statement, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said the incident happened on Saturday as its vessels were heading to Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands.It described China's actions as \"excessive and unlawful\", adding that they also violated international law.Meanwhile, the US Department of State voiced its support for \"our Philippine allies\".\"Firing water cannons and employing unsafe blocking manoeuvres, PRC [China's] ships interfered with the Philippines' lawful exercise of high seas freedom of navigation and jeopardised the safety of the Philippine vessels and crew,\" the department said in a statement.China ignores an international arbitration court's ruling that its claim to almost the entire South China Sea is ill-founded.The South China Sea is now one of the world's biggest flashpoints, especially as US-China tensions have soared in recent years.Access to these waters is key to defending Taiwan at a time when China's claims over the self-governed island have intensified.",

    "text": "Storms bearing unusually torrential rain and ferocious winds this early in the north Pacific typhoon season have flooded large swathes of East Asia, with China among the countries worst hit.In the capital of Beijing alone, the amount of rain over the past week has broken a 140-year-old record.Doksuri slammed into China last weekend and drenched the north-east for most of the week. The region had barely recovered from typhoon Talim the week prior.Then, there's the threat of typhoon Khanun out at sea off China's east coast, which threatens to intensify rains in areas hit by Doksuri.In areas where the floods have subsided, residents have started shovelling mud out of their homes. The following three photos were also taken in Beijing.While storm-weary Filipinos went about with as much of their daily routines as they could, the typhoons highlighted perennial problems of flooding in the capital, Manila, and its suburbs of Bulacan and Pampanga.Slow-moving Khanun lashed Okinawa in the middle of the week and threatens to curve back to mainland Japan while intensifying rains in China.It cut power to one-third of Okinawa in its wake and shut the airport for a day during peak tourism season.In the first two weeks of July alone, floods and landslides there have killed almost 100 people in the north.",

I feel really good about where I am now mentally and physically,\" she said.\"I still think there are some things to work on in my routine but, for the first meet back, I would say it went pretty well. I'm very shocked and surprised. I'm very happy now that it is out of the way.\"She began on the uneven bars, where her score of 14.000 points was the third-best overall before claiming the meet's top score on the balance beam with 14.800.Biles drew cheers during and after every tumbling run on the floor exercise, her flips and landings bringing roars that were rewarded with a top score of 14.900 points.She finished on vault, soaring high to notch another leading mark of 15.400.Leanne Wong, 19, finished second, five points off the pace on 54.100, with 17-year-old Joscelyn Roberson third on 54.050.It was Biles' first competition since pulling out of five of her six finals at the delayed Tokyo Games in 2021.She later explained she had been suffering from the 'twisties' - a mental block where gymnasts can lose their sense of space in the air.Biles has yet to indicate whether she will aim to make next year's Olympics in Paris.She has qualified for the US national championships, which start on 24 August, and is hoping to compete for a world title in Antwerp in October.\"I always kind of knew [I'd return] as soon as everything happened in Tokyo,\" she said. \"This time I'm doing it for me.\"I worked a lot on myself and I believe in myself a little bit more. It's just coming back out here and starting those first steps again.\"",

    "title": "Sweden knock holders USA out of World Cup",
    "text": "Last updated on .From the section Women's World CupReigning champions the USA are out of the Women's World Cup after being stunned by Sweden on penalties on a night of incredible drama in Melbourne.The drama only ratcheted up further in the shootout. Three USA players, including their footballing icon Megan Rapinoe on her last appearance on the world stage, missed before Sweden won in remarkable circumstances.USA keeper Alyssa Naeher appeared to have saved Lina Hurtig's effort at the second attempt, having pushed the initial effort up before clawing it out.But after checking with the video assistant referee (VAR), referee Stephanie Frappart awarded the goal and sparked wild Sweden celebrations.Sweden go through to face Japan in the quarter-finals.They were indebted to Musovic, who made 11 saves in a game where the USA looked more like the team which won the World Cup in 2015 and 2019 than the one which snuck through the group stage.But they could not score and in the shootout Rapinoe, Sophia Smith and Kelley O'Hara all missed, Rapinoe with what is her final action at a World Cup as she has announced she will retire at the end of the year.It condemns the USA to their worst performance at a Women's World Cup. They had never previously failed to make it to the semi-finals.USA had not turned up to the World Cup party before Sunday. Flat and uninspired as they finished second in Group E while failing to win two first-stage matches for the first time in this competition, they have been subject to fierce criticism back home.Manager Vlatko Andonovski had to make changes - especially as key midfielder Rose Lavelle was suspended for this game - and moved Julie Ertz from centre-back into midfield as the USA switched from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1.It worked a treat in the first half as they dominated play and were only denied the lead by Musovic and the crossbar.Trinity Rodman twice stung the gloves of Musovic before Lindsey Horan came even closer by rattling the woodwork with a header from a corner.USA looked like a proud side stung into action by external criticism and internal knowledge that they have not been good enough so far. A ball recovery time of just six seconds in the first half was evidence of that.They continued to make chances after the break, Horan and Alex Morgan denied by superb Musovic saves and Emily Sonnett shooting over from the edge of the area.But they needed a goal to make their dominance count and, as they toiled for it, the crowd which had followed them to Melbourne were becoming more nervous as the game rolled on into extra time.They continued to be denied by Musovic in the extra period as she saved from Morgan, Lynn Williams and Sophia Smith, with Andonovski sending on Rapinoe shortly before the 100th minute.The 38-year-old has long been the team's defining symbol and inspiration - but here she blazed the fourth USA penalty wildly over the bar.Smith put well wide when the USA would have advanced if she scored, before O'Hara struck the post.The dreams of the USA being the first nation to win three successive World Cups is over. Their reign as undisputed queens of the global women's game is also finished.Sweden breezed through Group G with a 100% record. However, the four-time world champions are a big step up from South Africa, Italy and Argentina.Sweden were reliant on Musovic, who spent most of last season as back-up for Women's Super League champions Chelsea - but she proved why she is number one for her country here.In the 53th minute Horan's first-time shot following a low cross from the right seemed destined for the bottom corner, only for Musovic to make a brilliant low one-handed stop to her left despite being unsighted by Trinity Rodman stood in front of her.Even better came in the final seconds of normal time as Morgan headed down from point-blank range, only for Musovic to palm the ball way.Sweden did get more of a measure of their opponents as the game wore on, but still had to defend deep as waves of USA attacks crashed upon them. They did not have their first shot on target until the 85th minute, Sofia Jakobsson firing straight at Naeher.Ultimately they were reliant on Musovic to get them to penalties - when the greatest drama played out, and the once unbeatable USA were toppled.",

But local officials later posted the same image adding details about the attack on what they described as a non-residential building.President Zelensky also said that on Saturday Russia separately carried out a missile attack, targeting an aeronautical company run by group Motor Sich in the western Khmelnytskyi region.Last week, an office block on a Moscow skyscraper was hit two days in a row by Ukrainian drones, Russian authorities said.Moscow has also accused Ukraine on Saturday of hitting a Russian tanker with 11 crew members in the Black Sea - the second such sea drone attack in as many days.Russian maritime officials said the engine room of the Sig tanker was damaged in the attack in the Kerch Strait. No-one was injured.The Kerch Strait connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, separating Crimea - Ukraine's peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014 - and Russia's Taman peninsula.Ukraine has not publicly commented.
